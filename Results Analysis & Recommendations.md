# Analysis of Results

This document provides an analysis of the results obtained from the transformation and evaluation tasks. We focus on the GMM encoderâ€™s performance and propose improvements for handling extreme values.

## Summary of Results

### Task 1: Processing Time for Large Dataset

- **Total Processing Time for All Chunks**: 7.33 seconds
  - The chunked, parallel processing approach efficiently handles large datasets.
  - **Conclusion**: This method allows us to process up to 1 billion rows without overwhelming memory.

### Task 2: Accuracy and Processing Time

#### Extreme Values

- **Transformation Time**: 0.000999 seconds
- **Inverse Transformation Time**: Effectively zero
  - These times are very low, indicating the model quickly processes extreme values.
  
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: 4,999,999,775
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: 7,071,067,494
  - **Interpretation**: The high MAE and RMSE suggest that the GMM encoder struggles to accurately represent extreme values. This could be due to the model's limitations in capturing outlier values.
  - **Conclusion**: GMM may not be the best model for handling extreme values, as it leads to significant encoding and decoding errors in these cases.

#### Full Dataset

- **Full Dataset Transformation Time**: 1.55 seconds
- **Inverse Transformation Time**: 0.01 seconds
  - **Conclusion**: The GMM encoder efficiently handles the full dataset with reasonable processing times.

- **MAE**: 326.58
- **RMSE**: 607.56
  - **Interpretation**: The low MAE and RMSE on the full dataset indicate that the GMM model performs well for standard data, with only minor deviations between original and inverse-transformed values.
  - **Conclusion**: The GMM encoder is accurate for typical data ranges, making it suitable for general data processing tasks.

## Recommendations

1. **Hybrid Encoding Strategy**:
   - **Problem**: The GMM model performs poorly with extreme values.
   - **Solution**: Use a hybrid approach where:
     - **Standard Data** is processed with GMM.
     - **Extreme Values** are transformed separately using methods like **Quantile Transformation** or **Clipping**.

2. **Increase `n_clusters` for Finer Resolution**:
   - **Adjustment**: Increasing `n_clusters` could help the model better capture variations within the dataset. However, this may increase processing time.

3. **Alternative Models**:
   - **Suggestion**: For datasets with frequent extreme values, consider alternative methods like **Kernel Density Estimation** or **Isolation Forest** for improved outlier handling.

## Conclusion

The current approach works well for standard data but has limitations with extreme values. Implementing a hybrid encoding strategy can help improve accuracy while maintaining efficiency, making this solution better suited for both general and extreme datasets.
